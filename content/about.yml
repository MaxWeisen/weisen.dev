  Hello, my name is **Max Weisenberger** and I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Revolution Prep.
  I am based out of Long Beach, California. I have been writing code on a daily basis for the past 5 years.
  My main focus has been in the Education Tech space.

  One of my personal passions is automotive repair. I enjoy balancing the technical side of my life by 
  being outdoors. My two favorite outdoor activities are snowboarding and camping.

  ### My Engineering Process

  Building great software goes far beyond writing code, it starts with understanding what users 
  actually *want* and *need*. I begin every project by gathering insights through user interviews, analytics, 
  and surveys. This foundation shapes everything that follows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

  With user stories defined, I collaborate with UI/UX designers in tools like Figma, iterating on                                                                                                                           
  mockups and refining copy together. This shared design space keeps everyone aligned and moving quickly.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  In parallel, back-end architecture takes shape. User stories guide decisions around API endpoints                                                                                                                         
  and database schema, ensuring the technical foundation supports what we're building.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  As portions of the design are finalized, I build out the front-end constantly deploying to a test 
  environment along the way. This lets stakeholders and test users experience the product as it evolves.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  Once front-end and back-end are integrated, I gather feedback from test users and iterate. When                                                                                                                           
  we've addressed their concerns, we're ready to ship.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  But launching isn't the finish line. I monitor performance through analytics and real user data,                                                                                                                          
  continuously iterating on the UI/UX. Delivering real value means treating software as a living product,                                                                                                                   
  not a one-time deliverable.

  ### My Motivation

  I have always loved building and fixing things. As a child, my friends and I would construct makeshift
  sheds out of scrap wood, proudly calling them our "clubhouses." In my teenage years, I channeled that
  same passion into automobiles, performing my own maintenance and repairs, learning how engines work
  from the ground up. Through it all, I fell in love with the process of learning and mastery itself.

  When I discovered software as an adult, I found that same rewarding process, but with the potential
  to help far more people. Working in Education Tech has given me the opportunity to help students of
  all ages achieve their academic goals. It has shown me the incredible impact that teams can create
  when supported by software that delivers real value.

  ### Outside of Tech

  To balance my life in tech, I spend as much time outdoors as I can. Every year I go camping with a 
  close group of friends, and living in Southern California gives me easy access to the Angeles 
  National Forest for hiking and exploring. When winter comes around, you'll find me on the slopes 
  snowboarding.
