## Overview

Revolution Prep has historically used "hours" as currency for users to consume their products. In an effort to allow users to reserve more than just hourly based products, we wanted to enable "credit" based enrollments. With this change users have the option to enroll in our Small Group Course offerings in addition to one on one tutoring products.

## The Challenge

- Using hours is deeply engrained in our existing architecture.
- Handling users who have both "hour" and "credit" based enrollments.
- Communicating what users can redeem credits for.

## Motivation

- We want to provide our users with more options.
- Enabling users to be able to schedule Small Group Courses with their credits allows them to get more tutoring help with less cost.

## Goals

- Get more users enrolled in Small Group Courses.
- Have less friction when reserving sessions or scheduling with a tutor individually.
