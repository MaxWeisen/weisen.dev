  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    With 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I've learned that great software goes beyond code. 
    It requires strong communication, thoughtful design, and technical expertise to solve real problems effectively.          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    My BA from California State University, Fullerton provides the foundation I build on with every project.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
    I approach engineering with scalability and maintainability at the forefront, drawing from deep
    experience across industries and use cases.
